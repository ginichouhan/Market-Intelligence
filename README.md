# 🏫 Market Research & Messaging Customization for School Outreach

This project demonstrates a structured approach to identifying schools engaged in innovation programs and organizing a smart outreach system using Google Sheets.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To research, organize, and manage outreach efforts using an efficient data system that:
- Identifies innovative schools.
- Categorizes them for better messaging.
- Tracks communication and tailors outreach efforts.

---

## 📖 Scenario

You are assigned the task of:
- Finding schools engaged in innovation initiatives (e.g., STEM, robotics, entrepreneurship).
- Designing a Google Sheet to manage outreach communication.
- Using data-driven techniques to improve messaging and follow-ups.

---

## 🔍 Research Requirements

For each school, collect the following details:

- **School Name**
- **Type of Innovation Program** (e.g., STEM Club, Design Thinking)
- **Claims to Parents** (e.g., “21st-century learning”, “Tech-first education”)
- **Source of Information** (Website, News article, Social media)

---

## 🧺 Baskets (Categorization)

Group schools based on shared traits such as:

- **Program Type** (e.g., STEM, Entrepreneurship, Robotics)
- **School Size**
- **Geography** (Urban vs. Rural)
- **Budget** (High vs. Low resource programs)

Create clear, consistent categories to compare and tailor communication.

---

## 📊 Google Sheet Structure

Create **three main tabs**:

1. **Raw Data** – School research information
2. **Baskets** – Categorized groups
3. **Messaging Log** – Communication history

### Key Columns:
- Messaging Status: “Drafted”, “Sent”, “Awaiting Response”, “Pending”
- Messaging Template Link
- Tailored Message Focus
- Custom Notes

---

## ⚙️ Automation Features

- ✅ **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight rows with missing or “Pending” messaging status in red.
- ✅ **Dropdown Menus**: For categories and status values to ensure consistent data entry.

---

## 📨 Messaging Tracker

Track outreach to each school with:

- Tailored message suggestions (e.g., "Focus on STEM success", "Highlight partnership potential")
- Notes column to log customizations
- Date sent or follow-up reminders (optional)

---

## 📈 Data-Driven Suggestions

Based on your sheet, identify **2–3 priority schools** and explain how:
- Their traits make them good outreach targets
- Your message strategy can be customized for maximum impact

Example:
> “School X focuses heavily on robotics in rural areas – our messaging can highlight tech-inclusion and funding collaboration.”
